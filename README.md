# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-XGBoost

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer as either malignant or benign based on the dataset provided by the University of Wisconsin. The project uses the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful machine learning technique for classification tasks.

## Overview

The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training using XGBoost, evaluation of the model's performance, and a feature importance analysis to identify significant predictors of cancer malignancy.
